This directory contains the out-of-date code for the
retired codelab, Firebase + Flutter, that extended the chat app to

You can find the original instructions in this repo, under `full_steps`.
[OriginalFirebaseforFlutterCodelab.pdf](https://github.com/flutter/friendlychat-steps/tree/master/full_steps/OriginalFirebaseforFlutterCodelab.pdf).

We are keeping this around because some people use it.
